Roadmap PixelController
-----------------------
-Do not freeze application if output fails (disconnect serial controller)
-Particle generator (rain,snow,fireworks...) remember: maybe rip from cocos2d particle system, should replace fire and metaballs
-More layouts (Half/Half, 3/1...). Current layouts are hardware dependant. New layout shouldn't be. 
   +---+---+---+
   | a | b | c |
   +---+---+---+   
   | d | e | f |
   +---+---+---+   
 Example: 3/1 Layout defines 2 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e panel 2 using physical panel c and f.
 Example: Fancy Layout defines 3 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e, panel 2 using physical panel c
          panel 3 using physical panel f
-Artnet output: support multiple output devices
-Unit Testing is suboptimal, the file config.properties is not used 
-Support Renard Protocol
-Option to invert GUI colors
-More GUI improvments (scaling, bigger fonts, save window position, option to bring both windows to front)
-Option to modify colorsets of all visuals
-implement colorlib procesing lib (http://code.google.com/p/colorlib/)
-Add Perlin Noise generator
-Run headless (Use case: PixelController runns on a remote computer and PixelController is controlled via OSC)
 see https://sites.google.com/site/stamb2012/examples/batch-processing
-add option to query buffersize via OSC
-add more fader (pixel fader for example)
-disable beat detection if sound volume is too low
-support more than 2 rows
-support teensy 3 (pixelinvaders firmware)
-Option to save output of PixelController (byte stream) to a flat file
-Option to use system audio as input source, currently its only mic input. 
-Syphon support https://code.google.com/p/syphon-implementations/
-Even more speed for the PixelInvaders firmware:
	-optimize transfer size to be a multiple of 60 bytes (Arduino and Teensy hardware serial class has a buffer size of 64 bytes)
	-send reply (ack) only each 2nd frame? each 25th frame? side effects?
	-maybe a streaming only firmware?


Rejected roadmap features
-------------------------
-UDP output: support multiple output devices (probably not, alternative: use tpm2.net)
-Use Mozilla Rhino to create dynamic generators/effects
 -> using jdk1.6 rhino is just too slow and cpu intensive (it needs about 40% cpu power with one rhino js generator). 
    v8 (jav8) should a an alternative, however v8 is OS dependent.


Changelog v1.3.1 to v1.4.0
--------------------------
-Add support for E1.31 devices
-Add more 8x8 icon images
-Add new effect, rotate 90 degrees
-Add option to hide internal Visuals to save CPU power
-Add new generator: VisualZero. use the first visual as generator, you can chain you effects.
-Add new random preset mode
-Add Pass through mode: ScreenCaputure (always) and OSC Generator (depending on input) are now 
     24bpp generators, you cannot use effects/mixer/colorsets
-Add option to adjust the color for each PixelInvaders panel
-Add new gamme option, GAMMA 2.2 
-Fix: Checkbox mixer for larger resolutions
-Fix: find .png files in GUI
-Fix: Do not change selected visual and output if a preset is loaded
-Fix: Handle missing config files
-Fix: if the Null output and another output is configured, ignore null output and start PixelController
-Fix: Preset numbering and loading Preset 0
-Fix: Load Presets: do not display non-existent files in the GUI
-Fix: Textwriter generator, use 8bpp as temp buffer to prevent artefacts
-Fix: Improve Add and Sub Mixer (rollover) 
-PixelInvaders Output: Use Adler32 as caching mechanism instead of MD5 - much faster.
                       md5 needs about 1ms to generate, adler32 needs about 0.2ms.
                         2 panels, 50fps, save: 80ms/s, 6 panels, 20fps, save: 96ms/s
-Rainbowduino Output: Cleanup init code. 
-Optimize PixelInvaders Firmware, use Serial.readBytes instead Serial.read() (see http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/benchmark_usb_serial_receive.html)
 PixelInvaders Firmware is now 20% faster.
-Add a lot of new presets and cleanup unused presets


Changelog v1.3.0 to v1.3.1
--------------------------
-Updated PixelInvaders firmware, more speed, improved image quality
-Add two generic (OSC) input generators, see Processing examples (integration/Processing/OscSendImageData) how to use it.
 Hint: They get selected in random mode only if they are active (receiving data)
-Update OSC Server buffer size (32k) to accept image data
-Add OSC Statistics in GUI/JMX
-Artnet Output: respect color order (panel.color.order setting)
-Artnet Output: Add option to configure the Artnet broadcast address (was default 2.255.255.255)
-TPM2 Output: fix layout settings, for example ROTATE_180 caused an exception
-Serial Outputs (AdaVision, Rainbowduino v3, TPM2): fix serial port name issue, case sensitive (Issue #30)
-Add PixelInvaders Network device support using ser2net (for example using a Raspberry PI)
-Add output connection status for PixelInvaders panels
-Support Kinect for Xbox 360 via external Processing Sketch and OSC Generator
-Fix NPE during application launch and a key is pressed
-Fix NPE if using keyboard shortcuts to select a non existent generator (for example capture generator)
-Fix possible Freeze during Random Mode


Changelog v1.2.x to v1.3.0
--------------------------
-add integrated GUI!
-add Color-Sets, predefined color definition for all generators, effects and mixers
-add support for UDP output device
-add support for TPM2 serial output devices
-add support for TPM2 net output devices
-add support for rainbowduino v3 output devices
-add start scripts for OSX
-add flipX and flipY effects
-implement gamma correction
-support more output formats (not only RGB and RBG), thanks to noxx6
-updated PixelInvaders SPI firmware (lpd6803 and ws2801), much faster than the bit banging version
-update AdaVision driver
-Texturedeform is not a generator anymore but an effect
-Integrate OSC Server
-Reduce CPU load
-fixed Blinkenlight video player race condition
-improved rxtx lib, fix some 64bit issues
-configuration fixes
-alot of bugfixes
-removed emboss effect, as the result was ugly
-removed Xor and MinusHalf mixer, as the result was ugly
-removed image zoomer generator, as it looks ugly and was a duplicate.
-Manual


Changelog v1.1 to v1.2
------------------------
-PixelInvaders Firmware, fixed strip.doSwapBuffersAsap(0)
-Support AdaVision


Changelog v1.0.3 to v1.1
------------------------
-add notification if random mode is selected or not
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. 
 if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-decoupling visual generation from output update, should increase performance
-New Generators: ColorScroll, ColorFade and ScreenCapture. Removed Simple Colors
-PixelInvaders firmware: update initial image in firmware
-PixelInvaders firmware: add autonomous firmware mode, run simple animation if no computer is connected
-ScreenCapture: make capturing area visible to user
-create osc tabled gui for Control (OSC + MIDI) (http://charlie-roberts.com/Control)
-manual mapping to support fancy led mapping (OnePanelResolutionAwareOutput class). define a configuration property like 
 output.mapping=1,2,5,6,3,4,7,8 ...
-Log output to a file instead the command line
-artnet output: make first universe id configurable
-possible to start pixelcontroller with a preset
